This is a personal project of mine focused in helping with a problem: create and edit a Daemon's RPG character sheet.
For those who don't know, Daemon is a brazilian RPG system and it's such a pain to create a character sheet because there is a lot of rules, calculations and conditions.

For that, I developed this simple solution in witch you can only create (for now) your character.

I intend to upgrade the system for it to save and edit the characters; generate a PDF and also have a random generator.
For now, it only works as a prompt software, but i'm working in a front-end.

I'm excited to finish and if you wanna colaborate, feel free to contact me (I'm new here)

PS.: yes, the name was inspired in Phineas & Ferb.
